      <description>The Ground Game This week’s focus is on mobilization of voters and how voter turnout may have an impact on who does well in elections. Most often, campaigns will focus on turning out those who are infrequent voters that align well with their party and or candidate’s platform. Methods include texting, calling, and knocking on potential voter’s doors to get out the vote. One big question I will try to investigate is whether or not there’s a relationship between high turnout and the outcomes of either one of the major parties.</description>
