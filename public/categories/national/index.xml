      <description>In this post, I will investigate the effects that ad spending can have on the outcome of elections on a district by district level. Using my current model, I will incorporate data found on the FEC’s website to approximate ad spend on a campaign district level. Using how much money was spent will be my variable, though I am aware that some scholarship says that number of ads rather than money spent is also a good indicator.</description>

      <description>Expert Ratings In my previous blogs, I have focused solely at national variables and conditions which may affect our election outcomes. Things like GDP, unemployment, polling, etc. are very helpful tools but we also have the option to look at elections from a much closer, district level approach. On the district level, many experts watch and weigh in on important races. Organizations such as Cook Political Report and Sabato’s Crystal Ball take into account local conditions and determine ratings on an individual district level basis.</description>
