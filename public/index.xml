      <description>Expert Ratings In my previous blogs, I have focused solely at national variables and conditions which may affect our election outcomes. Things like GDP, unemployment, polling, etc. are very helpful tools but we also have the option to look at elections from a much closer, district level approach. On the district level, many experts watch and weigh in on important races. Organizations such as Cook Political Report and Sabato’s Crystal Ball take into account local conditions and determine ratings on an individual district level basis.</description>

      <description>Introduction This week, we focused on seeing how polling might affect and predict election outcomes. Gelman and King spoke about how polling is really only indicative of people’s preferences close to the election. Over the course of a campaign cycle, Gelman and King argue, responses to pollsters during the campaign are not generally informed or even, in a sense we describe, “rational.”
For this reason, when building and assessing a model this week, I will try to weigh the polls heavier when they are closer to the election day.</description>

      <description>This weeks blog post will focus on using the economy as a variable to predictive modeling for the upcoming election using past data such as the unemployment rate, GDP for each quarter, RDI, etc.
Introduction There has been extensive research showing that prospective voters substantially consider the state of the economy when making electoral decisions. Christopher H. Achen’s and Larry M. Bartels in Democracy For Realists argue that voters use the economy as a way to measure the performance of an incumbent party / president.</description>

I will be using the visualization customization extension for this blog post and will use the resulting data to make a prediction about the upcoming 2022 midterm election.
