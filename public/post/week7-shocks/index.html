<h1>Shocks and Election Impact</h1>
<p>This week, I will be doing the first blog extension. I will be replicating the Dobbs NYT example from section, but with the shock of recent inflation news. I predict that rising coverage on the state of the economy and inflation would have a negative affect on the President’s party (Democrats) for generic ballot support. I am unsure whether or not this would also translate to an increase in support for Republicans but I am certain that I predict to see some hesitation towards Democrats due to economic inflation and market performances. I will be using the NYT developer API to source my data for news coverage.</p>
<p>• Natural disaster: Shark attack (Achen and Bartels 2017), tornado
(Healy and Malhotra 2010) ⇝ decreased support for incumbents
• Sports (Healy, Mo, Malhotra 2010): college football team losing
their game ⇝ decreased support for incumbents
• Lottery (Bagues and Esteve-Volart 2016): Towns winning Spanish
Christmas lottery ⇝ increased support for incumbents</p>
<p>Global comparison (Powell &amp; Whitten 1993): Punish only when
the gov’t is doing worse than other gov’ts
• Ex: the speed of recovery</p>
<p>I will also try to modify and revise my existing predictive model from week 6.</p>
