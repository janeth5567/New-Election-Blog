1. Give a brief general overview of the district: its geography, demographics, the candidates, its electoral history, and anything else important. 

Florida's 27th Congressional district is a mainly white and Latino district situated in the Southern tip of Florida and includes much of suburban Miami-Dade County. This district before Shalala and Salazar faced off twice, Florida's 27th Congressional District was for almost 30 years held by Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen — even though the district leaned Democratic when it came to casting votes for president. The voters in this district tend to lean Democrat for President but were very loyal to the Republican incumbent for 30 years while she served. 

As of the 2020 Census, Florida representatives represented an average of 769,220 residents.

2. Describe the forecasted outcome for this district and how closely the actual outcome in the district met this forecast.  The forecast can draw on your personal forecast or another source, for example, the average outcome for incumbents from the same party, the average nationwide shift for the party, or expert ratings.  You should describe quantitatively and/or qualitatively how closely the final outcome in the district matched expectations.  

Overall, the Republican incumbent candidate did better than was expected. This is an interesting trend which I think may be influenced by two factors: Latinos getting more republican and trends of Florida itself becoming less of a swing state. However, this could also be bc Charlie Crist was a really weak candidate.As we have talked about in class, there may be literature and debates in the political science community which doubts the validity of the claim that Latinos are becoming more republican. This claim mainly critiques the fact that most data about Latino voter preferences are based on exit poll data which is not nationally representative. 


Final 538 popular vote forecast: 
54.9 R, 45.1 D 
Politico insights: "Freshman GOP Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar ousted then-Rep. Donna Shalala by 3 points in 2020 — even as now-President Joe Biden carried this Miami seat by 4 points. After Republican-led redistricting, Biden would have lost the new seat by a point, making Salazar a tough out this time around for Democrat Annette Taddeo."

Today, under a redrawn district submitted by GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis and approved by the Republican-controlled legislature, the district is slightly redder than it used to be because it no longer includes Democratic-leaning Miami Beach. 


3. Drawing on the news you have been following and other sources if necessary, briefly summarize the campaign in the district.  For example, you might consider the candidates and issues of “candidate quality” and the volume and content of their campaign, including the air and ground campaign, and the associated news coverage.  Particular examples can be useful here. Be sure to cite your sources.

Salazar unsuccessfully ran for the seat before, in 2018, against Donna Shalala, who was Health and Human Services secretary during former President Bill Clinton's two terms, and later, president of the University of Miami.

Salazar defeated Shalala when the two faced each other again in 2020, when former Trump was on the ticket and had made inroads in Florida from his 2016 win.

During the 2020 race, Salazar pilloried Shalala for violating the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012 by improperly disclosing personal stock trades. But Salazar herself violated the STOCK Act earlier this year — something for which Taddeo has sharply criticized her.

Taddeo is a state senator who was running for the Democratic nomination for governor before dropping out of the race to run for Congress. 

Taddeo unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination for Congress in 2016 for a seat that went to former Rep. Joe Garcia. She was also on the lieutenant governor ticket in 2014 alongside Charlie Crist, the current Democratic nominee for governor. 

“The fact that Republicans have won the largest county, expanded their reach all over the state — it’s huge. It’s a recipe for disaster for the Democratic Party. They don’t have a way to win Florida without Miami-Dade,” said Kevin Cabrera, former Florida state director for Trump’s 2020 campaign and a newly elected member of the Miami-Dade County Commission.

“We had a turnout problem,” Shaw said. “You have got to go in these communities and organize and hold these coalitions together and talk to people and knock on the doors. And once we get some other money, do some other things.”

Personal note: worked for her years ago and thought the campaign was poorly run. Lots of attacking and mudslinging and not enough focus on issues. Also came into the race late because she was running for Governor before.

Candidate quality being low for both also probably contributed to the drop in overall turnout and votes.

4. Drawing on the literature from the class and, if necessary, other scholarly sources, speculate on how the campaign and candidates may have contributed to the deviations from the forecasted outcome.  Be sure to make citations to specific sources.

David Shor’s analysis was relevant to me. trying to create a check. Republicans were able to create a radical policy change without control so its possible that Democrats are gonna own this election
Be more positive, be more moderate, be less extreme. 

Also, the last discussion we had about Vavreck about insurgent and clarifying campaigns was extremely interesting to me as I feel like here the challenger, Taddeo made many mistakes according to Vavreck's formula on how to successfully run a campaign.
