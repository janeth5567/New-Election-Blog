<h1>Shocks and Election Impact</h1>
<p>This week, I will be doing the first blog extension. I will be replicating the Dobbs NYT example from section, but with the shock of recent inflation news. I predict that rising coverage on the state of the economy and inflation would have a negative affect on the President’s party (Democrats) for generic ballot support. I am unsure whether or not this would also translate to an increase in support for Republicans but I am certain that I predict to see some hesitation towards Democrats due to economic inflation and market performances. I will be using the NYT developer API to source my data for news coverage.</p>
<p>• Natural disaster: Shark attack (Achen and Bartels 2017), tornado
(Healy and Malhotra 2010) ⇝ decreased support for incumbents
• Sports (Healy, Mo, Malhotra 2010): college football team losing
their game ⇝ decreased support for incumbents
• Lottery (Bagues and Esteve-Volart 2016): Towns winning Spanish
Christmas lottery ⇝ increased support for incumbents</p>
<p>Global comparison (Powell &amp; Whitten 1993): Punish only when
the gov’t is doing worse than other gov’ts
• Ex: the speed of recovery</p>
<p>I will also try to modify and revise my existing predictive model from week 6.</p>

## Inflation + Biden News Punishing the Republicans More? ##
One possible explanation for the drop in both Democratic and Republican support could be that the coverage on inflation critiqued both sides, causing overall disillusion with the state of government and the economy. Interestingly enough, Republicans seem to be more punished than Democrats in this data. Correlation does not equate to causation so there may be a possibility than other news coverage in these weeks impacted Americans’ support of the parties.</p>
