<h1>Shocks and Election Impact</h1>
<p>This week, I will be doing the first blog extension. I will be replicating the Dobbs NYT example from section, but with the shock of recent inflation news. I predict that rising coverage on the state of the economy and inflation would have a negative affect on the Presidentâ€™s party (Democrats) for generic ballot support. I am unsure whether or not this would also translate to an increase in support for Republicans but I am certain that I predict to see some hesitation towards Democrats due to economic inflation and market performances. I will be using the NYT developer API to source my data for news coverage.</p>
<p>I will also try to modify and revise my existing predictive model from week 6.</p>
